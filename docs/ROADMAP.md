# Expense Tracking App - Development Roadmap

*Last Updated: August 26, 2025*

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… What We Have
- **Solid Foundation**: pnpm monorepo with mobile (Expo), API (NestJS), web (Next.js) apps
- **Feature-Rich Mobile App**: Complete expense tracking with groups, participants, categories, insights
- **Modern Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Zustand, React Navigation, NestJS, Expo 53
- **Development Infrastructure**: ESLint, Prettier, Jest testing setup

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues
- **Code Organization**: Multiple files violating 500-line limit (ExpenseInsightsScreen: 563 lines)
- **Architecture Debt**: Monolithic components, mixed concerns, refactoring plan unimplemented
- **API Gap**: Backend exists but still at "Hello World" stage
- **No Persistence**: All data stored locally in Zustand with no server sync

## Strategic Vision

### Long-Term Goal (12-18 months)
Transform from a local-only mobile prototype into a production-ready, multi-platform expense sharing application for couples and groups.

### Key Success Metrics
- **User Experience**: Sub-2-second app startup, offline-first functionality
- **Scalability**: Support 10k+ active couples, real-time sync across devices  
- **Code Quality**: 100% TypeScript coverage, <500 lines per file, 90%+ test coverage
- **Business Ready**: OAuth authentication, data privacy compliance, revenue model

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Code Foundation Cleanup (2-3 weeks)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Must complete before feature development**

#### 1.1 File Size Compliance (Week 1)
- Break down `ExpenseInsightsScreen.tsx` (563â†’<300 lines)
  - Extract chart components â†’ `components/insights/`
  - Move calculations â†’ `utils/insightCalculations.ts`
  - Create custom hooks â†’ `hooks/useExpenseInsights.ts`
- Refactor `ManageCategoriesScreen.tsx` (402â†’<300 lines)
- Split `expenseStore.ts` into feature-specific stores

#### 1.2 Component Architecture (Week 2)
- Implement atomic design system
- Extract 15+ reusable components from screen files
- Create shared component library in `components/ui/`
- Establish component documentation standards

#### 1.3 Business Logic Separation (Week 3)
- Move all calculations to `utils/` folder
- Create custom hooks for form management, data fetching
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation

### Phase 2: API Development & Integration (3-4 weeks)
**Priority: HIGH - Foundation for multi-user functionality**

#### 2.1 Database Design (Week 1)
- Design PostgreSQL schema for users, couples, expenses, categories
- Implement TypeORM/Prisma entities and migrations
- Set up local Docker development environment
- Create database seeding scripts

#### 2.2 Core API Endpoints (Week 2-3)
- Authentication: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/refresh`
- Users: CRUD operations with profile management
- Couples: Create/join couple functionality with invite codes
- Expenses: Full CRUD with validation and business rules
- Categories: Custom category management per couple

#### 2.3 Mobile-API Integration (Week 4)
- Replace Zustand local storage with API calls
- Implement React Query for caching and synchronization
- Add offline-first functionality with optimistic updates
- Create error handling and retry mechanisms

### Phase 3: Authentication & Multi-User (2-3 weeks)
**Priority: HIGH - Required for production use**

#### 3.1 Authentication System
- Implement Supabase Auth or Auth0 integration
- Add Google/Apple OAuth providers
- Create secure JWT token management
- Implement role-based access control

#### 3.2 Couple Management
- Partner invitation system via email/QR codes
- Expense sharing permissions and visibility rules
- Data migration for existing local users
- Account linking and merger functionality

### Phase 4: Real-Time & Sync (2-3 weeks)
**Priority: MEDIUM - User experience enhancement**

#### 4.1 Real-Time Updates
- WebSocket integration for live expense updates
- Push notifications for new expenses and invites
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Background sync when app becomes active

#### 4.2 Offline Functionality
- Comprehensive offline data caching
- Queue system for pending API calls
- Conflict resolution UI for merge conflicts
- Data integrity validation

### Phase 5: Web Dashboard (3-4 weeks)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Additional platform reach**

#### 5.1 Core Web Application
- Next.js 15 with App Router and Server Components
- Responsive design matching mobile UX
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF reports)

#### 5.2 Advanced Features
- Budget planning and forecasting tools
- Expense categorization with ML suggestions
- Integration with banking APIs (Plaid/Yodlee)
- Multi-currency support with real-time rates

### Phase 6: Production & Scale (4-6 weeks)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Business readiness**

#### 6.1 Infrastructure
- AWS/Vercel production deployment
- CI/CD pipelines with automated testing
- Database scaling and backup strategies
- Monitoring and logging (DataDog/Sentry)

#### 6.2 Business Features
- Subscription/premium tier functionality
- Analytics dashboard for usage metrics
- Customer support integration
- GDPR compliance and data export

## Technology Evolution Path

### Current Stack Optimization
- **Mobile**: Expo SDK 53 â†’ 54+, React 19 optimizations
- **Backend**: NestJS with GraphQL federation for scalability
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with read replicas, Redis caching
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React Server Components

### Future Technology Considerations
- **Mobile**: Expo Router for file-based routing
- **State Management**: Zustand â†’ Jotai for atomic state
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, React Testing Library expansion
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes for container orchestration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Mobile Performance**: Regular profiling, code splitting, image optimization
2. **Data Consistency**: Comprehensive testing of sync logic, transaction handling
3. **Scale Challenges**: Load testing, database optimization, caching strategies

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**: MVP testing with target couples, feedback iteration
2. **Competition**: Unique value proposition, superior UX focus
3. **Revenue Model**: Freemium validation, premium feature research
