# Function Log

_Last updated: September 23, 2025_

## How to Use

- Treat this as the single backlog: every requirement lives here with its current status, priority, and test touchpoints.
- Keep each row concise‚Äîone requirement per line‚Äîlinking to deeper docs instead of duplicating details.
- Update the status and priority immediately after working on an item; note the highest-level tests that cover it.
- When you spin up a new requirement, add it to the appropriate table with a quick Next/Notes entry so you remember the follow-up.
- If a requirement originated in `docs/ISSUE_LOG.md`, reference the issue ID in the Notes column (e.g., `Origin: ISS-002`) and archive the issue once shipped.

## Status Legend

`‚úÖ Implemented` finished and validated by listed tests
`üöß In progress` actively being built
`üîÑ Needs polish` functionally there but missing UX/coverage cleanup
`üìã Planned` captured in the backlog but no active work
`‚ùå Blocked` cannot proceed until a dependency lands

## Priority Buckets

`Now` currently on your plate or urgent
`Next` queued once Now items close
`Later` nice-to-have or future phase

## Backlog Snapshot

- **Now**: expand expense filtering/search, refine group name UX, expand category colors, finish API schema draft, testing coverage improvements (see docs/Testing/TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md).
- **Next**: group permission rules, unique user identifier, persistence provider contract rollout, API endpoints.
- **Blocked**: mobile ‚Üî API integration (waiting on core endpoints), monitoring rollout (needs production API).

## Maintenance Notes

- Review this log at the start/end of each session to bump dates, statuses, and priority buckets.
- When closing a requirement, ensure relevant tests exist and are noted; otherwise flag it as `üîÑ Needs polish`.
- Prune stale notes and add blockers as they emerge so the backlog stays trustworthy.
