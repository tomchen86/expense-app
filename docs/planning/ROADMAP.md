# Expense Tracking App - Development Roadmap

_Last Updated: September 19, 2025_

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… What We Have (September 2025)

- **âœ… Code Foundation**: All files under 500 lines, refactored architecture complete
- **âœ… Documentation System**: Enterprise-grade docs with testing strategy, ADRs, risk assessment
- **âœ… Feature-Rich Mobile App**: Complete expense tracking with groups, participants, categories, insights
- **âœ… Modern Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Zustand, React Navigation, NestJS, Expo 53
- **âœ… Development Infrastructure**: ESLint, Prettier, comprehensive testing framework
- **âœ… Quality Systems**: UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md, FUNCTION_LOG.md, three-layer planning

### ðŸš¨ Current Gaps

- **API Development**: Backend still at "Hello World" stage (Phase 2 priority)
- **No Persistence**: All data stored locally in Zustand with no server sync
- **Testing Implementation**: Strategy defined but not yet implemented
- **Authentication**: No user management or multi-user support

## Strategic Vision

### Long-Term Goal (12-18 months)

Transform from a local-only mobile prototype into a production-ready, multi-platform expense sharing application for couples and groups.

### Key Success Metrics

- **User Experience**: Sub-2-second app startup, offline-first functionality
- **Scalability**: Support 10k+ active couples, real-time sync across devices
- **Code Quality**: 100% TypeScript coverage, <500 lines per file, 90%+ test coverage
- **Business Ready**: OAuth authentication, data privacy compliance, revenue model
