# Session Summary - September 23, 2025
*Identity Phase: Migrations, Seeds, and CI Integration*

## Highlights
- Delivered the first two TypeORM migrations covering identity tables and required extensions.
- Added Postgres + sql.js `UserDevice` entities with parity test coverage.
- Implemented a deterministic default-settings seed script with idempotency checks.
- Wired the Postgres-backed identity test suite into the main GitHub Actions workflow.
- Updated schema/status documentation and function log to keep planning artifacts in sync.

## Technical Notes
- New migrations: `001_enable_extensions` enables `uuid-ossp` + `citext`; `002_identity_tables` creates `users`, `user_settings`, `user_auth_identities`, and `user_devices`.
- Jest now runs migration forward/rollback specs and seed specs as part of `pnpm --filter api test`.
- CI uses the postgres:15 service with health checks and sets `TEST_DATABASE_URL` for the API suite.
- Docs refreshed: `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `docs/Testing/IDENTITY_PHASE_STATUS.md`, `docs/Testing/IDENTITY_PHASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/FUNCTION_LOG.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Follow Ups
- Extend migrations/entities to collaboration and ledger domains per Task 2.1.
- Broaden seed coverage once categories and default data land.
- Monitor CI runtime impact after adding the Postgres service.

## Continuation – September 24, 2025

### Highlights
- Authored `003_collaboration_tables` migration covering couples, couple_members, couple_invitations, participants, expense_groups, and group_members.
- Implemented TypeORM entities (sql.js + Postgres variants) with dedicated Jest suites validating defaults, uniqueness, and regex-driven constraints.
- Expanded migration regression suite to assert three-migration chain application and rollback ordering.
- Delivered `004_expense_core` ledger migration with categories/expenses/splits/attachments, matching entities/tests, and default category seeding.
- Landed `005_indexes_and_triggers` to automate `updated_at`, enforce split balances, and add performance indexes across identity/collaboration/ledger tables.
- Enabled expense soft-delete workflow (TypeORM `DeleteDateColumn`) with Postgres regression coverage and partial index validation.
- Added `006`–`008` soft-delete extensions for categories, expense groups, participants, and attachments plus partial index/performance specs.
- Introduced deterministic demo seed (`seedSampleData`) with Postgres regression coverage for couples, participants, expenses, splits, and attachments.

### Notes
- Datasource factory now registers collaboration entities/migrations to keep sqlite + Postgres harnesses in sync.
- Documentation refreshed: schema reference, Task 2.1 plan, TDD plan, and changelog updated to mark collaboration, ledger, trigger/index, and soft-delete progress, including tenant isolation checks.
- Next milestone: implement trigger cost profiling and remaining performance regression suites, then seed richer fixtures for Task 2.2 handoff.
