# API Status & Next Actions (September 26, 2025)

## ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE: API Development

### Current State - API Infrastructure Complete

- **✅ Authentication System**: Complete JWT auth with mobile-compatible endpoints achieving 43/43 test suites passing
  - Registration, login, token refresh, user profile management
  - Persistence mode toggle (local_only ↔ cloud_sync) with timestamp tracking
  - Device registration and sync status management

- **✅ User Settings & Profile Management**: Full CRUD operations for user preferences
  - Profile updates (displayName, timezone, defaultCurrency, avatarUrl)
  - Notification preferences (expenses, invites, reminders)
  - Language and push notification settings
  - Device management (register, update, list, remove)

- **✅ Category Sync API**: Mobile-compatible category management
  - CRUD operations with validation and conflict prevention
  - Default category seeding and bootstrapping
  - Soft delete with expense usage protection
  - Mobile format compatibility with color/icon support

- **✅ Expense Management Engine**: Complete expense lifecycle with splits
  - Full CRUD with pagination, filtering, and search
  - Expense splits with validation ensuring totals match
  - Cents↔dollars conversion (mobile $25.50 → API 2550 cents)
  - Statistics aggregation by category and participant
  - Soft delete and audit trail support

- **✅ Collaboration APIs**: Participant and Group management
  - Participant CRUD for shared expense tracking
  - Group management with archival and member management
  - Integration with expense splitting and statistics

- **✅ Performance & Quality**: Production-ready infrastructure
  - All endpoints meet mobile performance requirements (<500ms)
  - TypeScript discriminated union types for type-safe error handling
  - Comprehensive integration test coverage (142/142 tests passing)
  - Database integration with PostgreSQL and TypeORM

## Immediate Next Steps - Mobile Integration & Production

1. **Mobile App Integration**
   - Update mobile app API configuration to use new endpoints
   - Test persistence mode switching from local-only to cloud-sync
   - Verify expense sync and data migration flows
   - Test multi-device scenarios with device registration

2. **Production Deployment Preparation**
   - Set up production database with migrations
   - Configure environment variables and secrets management
   - Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
   - Implement rate limiting and security middleware

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Conflict resolution for optimistic concurrency
   - Receipt upload and attachment management
   - Real-time notifications for shared expenses
   - Advanced analytics and reporting endpoints

Use these documents before modifying or planning API features; they capture the agreed contracts, TDD path, and cross-agent expectations.

## Update Discipline & Coordination

- Refresh the "Immediate Next Steps" section after each milestone and echo the change in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Cross-link any new specs or diagrams from this file so agents land on the latest sources of truth.
- Surface blockers in `docs/ISSUE_LOG.md` and mention them in daily summaries to keep the plan actionable.
- Record any out-of-band test runs (including commands and environment notes) so future agents can reproduce results quickly.
