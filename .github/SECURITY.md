# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the `main` branch and release tags cut from it. Please ensure you are on the latest commit before filing a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Do **not** open a public issue. Instead, use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-reports/about-private-vulnerability-reporting) or email `security@htchen.dev`.
2. Provide reproduction steps, impacted components, and any suggested mitigations.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within 2 business days and a prioritization update within 5 business days.
4. We will coordinate disclosure timing so fixes and mitigations are available before anything is shared publicly.

## Preferred Mitigations

If you can propose or contribute a fix, include:

- Tests covering the vulnerability where possible.
- Notes on backward compatibility or migration steps.
- Any configuration toggles needed for hotfix deployment.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
